We developed a replicable process to develop a cheap and portable water filtration system that can be taken from village to village easily or even transport the water a reasonable distance. the system uses a three stage filtration process that could clean and sanitize natural water using a dual stage particulate filter, carbon filter, and a UV filter.. We cut open an electric pump which was attached to the stand in such a way to pump the water only when the bicycle was in the pumping configuration. then attached it to the filters which were placed in a balanced configuration when transporting water. An added option was the UV filter which we were unsure would be feasible in the target communities yet if possible was highly recommended. For the UV filter two Dynamos and a small battery, to ensure consistent power delivery for the filter, were added.</p>",15);function R(e,n,t,i,o,a){return T}var C=t(1602),D=t.n(C);const k=(0,h.Z)(D(),[["render",R]]);var U=k;const W=[{path:"/",name:"Home",component:A},{path:"/work",name:"Work",component:O},{path:"/education",name:"Education",component:U}],F=(0,l.p7)({history:(0,l.PO)("/mohijazi/"),routes:W});var j=F;(0,i.ri)(c).use(j).mount("#app")}},n={};function t(i){var o=n[i];if(void 0!==o)return o.exports;var a=n[i]={exports:{}};return e[i].call(a.exports,a,a.exports,t),a.exports}t.m=e,function(){var e=[];t.O=function(n,i,o,a){if(!i){var r=1/0;for(c=0;c<e.length;c++){i=e[c][0],o=e[c][1],a=e[c][2];for(var s=!0,h=0;h<i.length;h++)(!1&a||r>=a)&&Object.keys(t.O).every((function(e){return t.O[e](i[h])}))?i.splice(h--,1):(s=!1,a<r&&(r=a));if(s){e.splice(c--,1);var d=o();void 0!==d&&(n=d)}}return n}a=a||0;for(var c=e.length;c>0&&e[c-1][2]>a;c--)e[c]=e[c-1];e[c]=[i,o,a]}}(),function(){t.n=function(e){var n=e&&e.__esModule?function(){return e["default"]}:function(){return e};return t.d(n,{a:n}),n}}(),function(){t.d=function(e,n){for(var i in n)t.o(n,i)&&!t.o(e,i)&&Object.defineProperty(e,i,{enumerable:!0,get:n[i]})}}(),function(){t.g=function(){if("object"===typeof globalThis)return globalThis;try{return this||new Function("return this")()}catch(e){if("object"===typeof window)return window}}()}(),function(){t.o=function(e,n){return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,n)}}(),function(){var e={143:0};t.O.j=function(n){return 0===e[n]};var n=function(n,i){var o,a,r=i[0],s=i[1],h=i[2],d=0;if(r.some((function(n){return 0!==e[n]}))){for(o in s)t.o(s,o)&&(t.m[o]=s[o]);if(h)var c=h(t)}for(n&&n(i);d<r.length;d++)a=r[d],t.o(e,a)&&e[a]&&e[a][0](),e[a]=0;return t.O(c)},i=self["webpackChunkmohijazi"]=self["webpackChunkmohijazi"]||[];i.forEach(n.bind(null,0)),i.push=n.bind(null,i.push.bind(i))}();var i=t.O(void 0,[998],(function(){return t(5302)}));i=t.O(i)})();
